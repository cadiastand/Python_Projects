This script implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. It provides a framework for defining vertices, edges, and computing paths between nodes.

Features
Graph Representation:

Supports weighted directed graphs with vertices and edges.
Each vertex can store its ID, name, edges, and shortest distance from a source vertex.
Shortest Path Calculation:

Computes the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Path Retrieval:

Retrieves the shortest path from the source to a target vertex.
Graph Initialization:

Allows creating a graph from a list of vertices and edges.
State Reset:

Resets the graph's state to allow re-computation of shortest paths.

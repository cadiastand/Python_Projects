This script provides a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) for storing and manipulating hierarchical data. It includes functionalities for insertion, search, and finding minimum and maximum values.

Features
Node Structure:

Each node in the tree stores a value and pointers to its left and right children.
Tree Operations:

Insert values into the tree while maintaining BST properties.
Search for a specific value in the tree.
Find the minimum and maximum values stored in the tree.
Array Initialization:

Populate the tree from an array of values.
Node Visit Tracking:

Count the number of visited nodes during search, minimum, and maximum operations.

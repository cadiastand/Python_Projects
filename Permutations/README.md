This Python script generates all permutations of a given list using a tree-based approach. It employs recursion and a custom tree structure to systematically explore all possible arrangements of the elements in the list.

Features
Tree-Based Permutations:

Constructs a tree where each node represents an element in the permutation.
Explores all possible combinations by recursively removing elements from the list.
Recursive Generation:

Uses a depth-first search approach to generate permutations.
